# Converterio
## A toy coordinate converter app

### Rationale
The main motif for starting this project boils down to a simplistic attempt to learn new _cool catz_ technologies (i.e. React, Electron, Webpack, ES6). And in general, as an excuse to become a better geospatial dev, while still building something remotely useful.

On this note, the original inspiration for Converterio comes from an "old" piece of software developed by [CISIS-CPSG](http://www.centrointerregionale-gis.it/): ConVergo.
This app allowed non-GIS professional to easily convert between different Coordinate Reference Systems, via a GUI interface.

Tthe challenge has been hence to recreate a similar instrument via the means of today's  technologies. Tools that exploit the modern web ecosystem and that didn't even exist back when ConVergo was in use.

In this sense, Converterio aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on the NoGIS paradigm, alongside (admittedly much better) tools such as, for instance, [DropChop](dropchop.io).

### Technicalities
TODO

#### UI Design for the Gh-Pages website
The original design of this page is Landio, a responsive HTML template, built on top of [Bootstrap 4](http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/) and based on the [Land.io Sketch [Peter Finlan](http://peterfinlan.com/). The template and the UI kit were coded by [Taty Grassini](http://tatygrassini.github.io/).
